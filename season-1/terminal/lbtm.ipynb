    "## How Marimo Addresses These Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Marimo solves these issues through reactive execution and automatic dependency tracking. Unlike Jupyter, marimo automatically detects dependencies between cells and executes them in the correct order, preventing the \"cells out of sync\" problem. You can't accidentally run cells in the wrong order because marimo maintains direct acyclic graph (DAG) for execution. For broken dependencies, marimo provides better error messages and dependency validation. When it comes to mixing SQL and Python, marimo treats SQL as a first-class citizen - you can write SQL queries directly in cells without magic commands, and results automatically flow between SQL and Python cells through reactive execution. The system is designed to maintain correctness automatically, so you focus on your analysis rather than managing execution state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, and marimo notebooks are `.py` files; no need for that unreadable `.ipynb` format!\n"
