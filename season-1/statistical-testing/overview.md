# Statistical Testing Overview

## Discussion Topics

- **Hypothesis testing fundamentals**
  - Null and alternative hypotheses
  - P-values, significance levels, and Type I/II errors
  - When statistical significance doesn't mean practical significance
  - Effect sizes (Cohen's d) and their interpretation

- **Common statistical tests**
  - Independent samples t-test (comparing two groups)
  - Chi-square test of independence (categorical associations)
  - One-way ANOVA for multiple group comparisons
  - When to use each test and their assumptions

- **Normality and assumptions**
  - Shapiro-Wilk test for checking normality
  - Why we often assume normality even when data doesn't pass tests
  - Real-world pragmatism vs textbook requirements
  - Robust alternatives when assumptions are violated

- **A/B testing in practice**
  - Control vs treatment group comparisons
  - Sample size considerations and power analysis
  - Interpreting results for business decisions
  - Common pitfalls in experimental design

- **Distribution analysis**
  - Fitting data to theoretical distributions
  - Parameter estimation and goodness-of-fit
  - When and why different distributions matter
  - Practical applications in business and science

- **Correlation and regression**
  - Pearson correlation vs causation
  - Linear regression interpretation (slope, RÂ², p-values)
  - Limitations of linear models
  - When to use correlation vs regression analysis
